## Themes
We have moved from a purely mechanical world,to a world with mechanical/electrical machines and computers on the fringe... to a world where those lines have been blurred and even erased.

Licensing has changed the game. Software proprietary licenses

With the shift from mechanized to automated, the product becomes the software, with he mechanical shell being merely a harness or scaffolding for rolling patches and updates. Instead of paying for repairs we pay for software updates. In a sense it insures longevity and promotes reduction of waste.

This is perhaps in contrast with marketing and revenue generating practices, waiting to roll out features over a long stream of iterative sand semantic versions
